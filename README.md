Hello everyone, I recently talked about some problems in sapphire plus v1.1 ((double z+belt) + 5x tmc) software. The most troublesome one of them was that the mesh could only move 0.1 mm and 1 mm when leveling, therefore precision table adjustment was not made. For the solution of this problem, many people suggested that I switch to software with a marlin interface, because I did not like it, I started to deal with it myself and using several sources and different software, I added 0.01 and 0.05 mm movement steps to the original interface. In addition, 3d touch did not work in some software, now 3d touch is also working. My request from those who want to try the software will be to take a look at the settings in the text file, because I am not very knowledgeable about those settings, there may be settings we need to change.
