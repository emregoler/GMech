Hello everyone, I recently told my friends on facebook about some problems with the software sapphire plus v1.1 ((double z+belt) + 5x tmc). The most troublesome of these was that precise table adjustment could not be made as the net could only move 0.1 mm and 1 mm during leveling. To solve this problem, many people suggested that I switch to a software with a marlin interface, because I did not like it, I started to handle it myself and using several sources and different software, I added 0.01 and 0.05 mm movement steps. to the original interface. Also 3d touch was not working in some software, now 3d touch works too. My request to those who want to try the software would be to take a look at the settings in the text file, because I don't know much about those settings, so there may be settings we need to change.
